Interval-Driven Robust Control Suite

This suite is developed to estimate the negative-definite and invariant set in state-control space of a specific plant (plant nominal model see allinone***.txt). Run robust_asy_IA_combine.py to get negative-definite domain. Run robust_ia_map.py to get the the negative-definite and invariant set, the result will be saved as *.csv.

[pyIbex](http://benensta.github.io/pyIbex/) is needed.
